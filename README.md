Classification and detection of learning disabilities (majorly dyslexia) among different age groups using ML and provide materials that help assess their disabilities.

Random Forest Regressor is used to predict the writing score, which is a continuous target variable, and a Random Forest Classifier is employed to predict whether the individual has dyslexia (binary classification). Both models are wrapped in multi-output versions to handle these dual outputs simultaneously.
